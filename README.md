# PSD-AP06 (SOS message transmitter)

Welcome to our final project repo, the goal of our project is to make an encrypt/decrypt message transmitter with implementing Casear shift logic

## Features

- SOS Button
- Help Button 
- Message Encrypter
- Message Decrypter


# How it works?
First the user need to put some password to access the message feature, the password can be find the password in the code or by simply brute force it until ypu find the right answer. After that the user can choose wether he want to use the "emergency button function" or send the message manually, if the user choose to use the emergency button, the program will automaticly send the encrypted message. If the user want to send the message manually, the user can modify the shift length and direction. After that user can add the message and the message will be encrypted/decrypted based on the user choice earlier.

## Tech

This application is built using:

- [VHDL] - A programming language used to describe and model digital electronic systems.
- [VSCode] - An application used for creating VHDL programs for the SOS Message Transmitter.
- [ModelSim] - An application used to simulate the VHDL program that has been created.
